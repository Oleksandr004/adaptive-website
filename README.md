# Vegetable Delivery Website

This project is a fully responsive vegetable delivery website built using **React** (Vite) and **SCSS**. The website features a clean and adaptive layout using responsive units of measurement (like `rem`, `em`, `vw`, `vh`), media queries for different screen sizes, a pop-up menu, and a burger menu for smaller devices.
